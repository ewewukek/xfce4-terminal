Bug tracking system
===================

Xfce Terminal uses the Xfce bug tracking system at https://gitlab.xfce.org/apps/xfce4-terminal,
hosted and maintained by the Xfce project.


Patches
=======

Please submit merge requests to the Xfce GitLab instance.
Your code must comply with the coding style described below.

Please base on work against the master branch of this package. You can always
clone the Xfce Terminal repository from

  https://gitlab.xfce.org/apps/xfce4-terminal


Feature requests
================

Please file feature requests to the Xfce's GitLab
(https://gitlab.xfce.org/apps/xfce4-terminal).
Make sure that your feature request wasn't reported already before; requesting
a feature several times won't increase the changed that it gets added!


Coding Style
============

 - GNU coding conventions, with GLib-like extensions, mostly the same
   as GTK+.
 - Always expand tabs. This differs from the GNU suggestion, but is
   necessary!
 - Don't follow the philosophy "If it works, it's right" that most
   open source projects follow, instead Xfce Terminal's philosophy is
   "It doesn't work unless it's right".
